## Background
The financial markets supposedly accurately reflect each stock's underlying value. However, every now and then it’s proven that emotions also drive the stock market. Investors can fundamentally change the market’s evaluation of a stock (or stocks) through irrational decisions. One example of this occurred in January 2021 when Reddit users started to generate large amounts of positive sentiment around 'meme stocks' such as Gamestop and AMC. Thsi resulted in massive stock price increases such as GME going from single digits to almost $500. Those stock prices rose purely based on emotion and wild speculation. This project is an effort to analyze and rank stocks from Reddit based user sentiment.

## Motivation 
The motivation of this project is the recent incident happened on Reddit website in Jan 2021. This project objective is to leverage people’s emotion to make informed decisions to buy and sell stocks.
